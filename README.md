# chat-translator
Python project created with tkinter and the google gemini API to translate text messages between users.
Notes for the project:
- Visit https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key to recieve a free gemini key
- Create a dabase using phpmyadmin and create 5 columns as such: id (increment of +1 per message), username (derived from the code), language (english or spanish), message (derivered from code), time (updates automatically)
- A new database needs to be created for each chat if implemented- to ensure that messages are stored properly and old messages from other chats aren't added

Hope you like the idea and please reach out to me for any feedback
